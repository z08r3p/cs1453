INFOSYS   110 Digital   Systems   (Exam)
2021
i            Exam   Case   -   Fetu'u   - A   digital   platform   to   get   into   an   IT   career.Fetu'u   is   a   digital   platform   designed   to   make   it   easier   for   people   to   get   into   a   career   in   IT.   It   provides upskilling, allows   people to identify   career pathways   , and connects   mentors   to students   based on their common interests   and career objectives   .
The platform   has   been in development for a couple of years   and   is   being   readied for   release   later   in   2021. One   of   its   founders   , Saia   Mataele,   says   his   first   focus   is   to   target   Maori   and   Pasifika,
because of their historically   low   participation rates   in   IT.   He wants to increase diversity   in   the   technology   sector and believes   his   platform. will be able   to   help   make that   happen.
How   it works
Students   need to create an online profile   and answer several questions   about themselves   and their   goals   . These might include what   they   studied at university, any   extracurricular   activities   they   do,
what type of skills   and   jobs they   are interested in,   and any   companies   they   want to find   out   more   about.Members   can edit their online profile at any time,   but   the   real   magic   happens   behind   the   scenes   ,      where the developers   have created systems that can provide tailored content for   each   individual.   These analytics   allow   Fetu’u’s   digital platform   to have four main features:
1.   Learn
Fetu’u will recommend further learning opportunities   based on the student’s   current experience   and future goals   . These might include studying at   registered academic   institutions   , as   well   as            nano-degrees   and relevant podcasts   .
2.   Showcase
Saia Mataele knows that a   huge   part of   making   IT   attractive for   Maori and   Pasifika   students   is         to show them   people who have achieved success   in the industry   and are of   Maori   and   Pasifika   heritage. This   platform. will allow   members to hear directly   from   these   people   and   learn   about their   journey   and what they’ve done in the industry.
3.   Mentoring
The advanced business   analytics will allow   Fetu’u to automatically   match members with   relevant mentors   based on their profile   data.
4.   Pathways
It’s   hoped that the analytics   embedded in the platform. will allow   recruiters   to   quickly   and   easily   find   future   talent.
Future options   -   not everyone has   access to the internet,   so they   plan to   go   even wider.   One   option   is   a licensing model for school programs where their teachers   can get   information and   resources            to help educate students   as   schools   don’t currently teach the skills   that this   industry   requires   .


1            In order to   justify the continued funding and utilisation of   Fetu’u   instead of any   other   substitute
platforms for the same purpose,   Fetu’u must be   capable   of generating   useful   information for   both   the organisation and the students   . This   can be considered as the   competitive   advantage   of the platform   .
Using the information from the exam   case, suggest:
a. one   item   mentioned   that   has   been   historically   non-digital,   but   has   now   become   “digital-first”   .   Briefly   explain   your   answer. (4 marks)
b. one   example   of   a   TPS   and   one   example   of   a   DSS   that   Fetu’u   utilises   in   the   process   of generating such useful information.   (4   marks)
c   . two examples   of data collected by your TPS and two   examples   of   information   generated   by   your   DSS.   (4   marks)
d.   using   your   examples   above, how   Garbage   In, Garbage   Out   (GIGO) may   happen   at   Fetu’u,   what the likely   outcome will be, and how such   problem   may   be   avoided.   (4   marks)

2       The organisational structure of   Fetu’u consists   of several departments   ,   including   Systems
Development, Student   Liaison,   Data   Analysis   , Accounting      Finance, and   Sponsor   Liaison. Fetu’u   has the option of (a)   having a cross-organisation information system   running with a   centralised
database, or (b) to let each department   run and   maintain   its   own   information system   .Based   on   what   you   have   learnt   from   INFOSYS110, which   option   will   you   recommend   to   Fetu’u?

3         Saia knows that he will   need to   use   business   analytics   to   make sense   of the data   but   is   unsure   of   which techniques   are available to him   .   Explain how the two data   mining techniques   we   have
studied in class   can   help   Saia to:(a) reduce   the   need   to   spend   time   focusing   on   each   individual   member   (5   marks), and    (b)   help   to   identify   which   learning   content   might   be   relevant   to   each   member.   (5   marks)   Keep   your   answer   to   each   part   under   100 words   .
In your answer, include your choice of technique for each purpose, a   brief description of the   technique, and a short   explanation about why this technique   is   suitable.

4         Saia   has   , by   using   Data   Analytics   techniques   , successfully   categorised   the   Year   1   and   Year   2   students   into   three   categories   , based   on   the   levels   of   help   that   they   are   likely   to   require.   In   the report for the management team   at   Fetu’u, Saia intends to   use the following visualisation to   illustrate   the   differences   in   the   distribution   of   students   for   Years   1  2.   Category   1 being   students who are keen, and are in need of   intensive   support.   Category   2   consists   of students   who   are   managing well, while Category   3 is for students who are   doubtful   about   a   career   in   IT.
   
Identify three aspects   about this visualisation that needs   to   be addressed   and   improved.   For   each   aspect, explain why   it is   a problem   , and suggest how   it   may   be   addressed   and   improved.

5            Before   Saia   and   his   team   of   three   staff   can   release   Fetu’u’s   digital   platform   ,   some   final   work   is
required.   If   they   are   going   to   achieve   their   goal   of   a   July   2021 release, the   following   things   will   need to   be   done:
·       Record and edit videos   of successful Maori    Pacifica members   of the   IT industry   for the   “showcase” section of the platform   ,
·       Collate and embed learning opportunities   relevant to the Supply   Chain Management   pathway,
.      Finalise agreements with recruitments   companies   so that they   can place their logos   on the   platform   .
a.   Getting the   Fetu’u platform   ready for release is   a   project.   State four   characteristics   about   this job that qualifies   it as   a project. Briefly   explain how   each   of the characteristics apply. (8   marks)
b. What   is   the   time   constraint?   (3   marks)
c   . What   is   the   cost   constraint?   (3   marks)
d.   It   soon   becomes   clear   that   the   team   of   4 will   not   be   able   to   complete   all   of   the   above
activities   before July   2021. Suggest one way that   Saia can proceed   and   suggest   the   likely   impact   on   the   "quality   ” of   the   project.   (8   marks)

6       Although   Fetu’u will provide a   positive   impact for   both   its   members   and the   industry   as   a whole,
Saia knows   he needs to find a way to fund the   platform   financially.   The   data warehouse will store   a   vast amount of member data which might be useful for   employers   ,   universities   ,   and   even
Government institutions   .
A   large online recruitment firm   has   approached   Fetu’u and offered to fund the data storage costs   if   they   (and all their employees) are allowed full access to all student data.Provide one security   and two ethical considerations   Saia should consider in storing and selling      access to the data to this   online recruitment firm   .   For each consideration, recommend   one   way   that the risk   can be mitigated or minimised.   Explain   and   justify   your   recommendations   .
